## Hue Boomerang

Watched a video recommended by a friend from the Kienan Lefferty channel, [Shading Skin and You!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DMND846yjU). He describes the hue shift of the face as a "hue boomerang". The hue boomerang is as follows:

- The highlights are usually desaturated and warm.
- The midtones are saturated and shifted up to a warmer value.
- The shadows are desaturated and shifted toward purple. 

This general shape is described as the "Hue Boomerang". This video reminded me of a post on James Gurney's Blog, a post titled [The Color Zones of The Face](http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/2008/05/color-zones-of-face.html).
