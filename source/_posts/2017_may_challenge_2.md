[Scott Robertson's](https://youtu.be/INHeI6Lwtes) video on improving draftsmanship & proportional sensitivity surprised me. I didn't think it would involve something like typography! I've been taking graphic design classes for two years now and the trend today (at least in my program) is that designers don't *really* draw anymore. They may dabble but the projects Robertson talks about in this video are a far cry away from our actual assignments. We are completely absorbed in process, research, and taste. When a designer in my program needs an illustration or a photo, they more often than not just find one online. This video may have convinced me to dabble in typography again. 

**Quote from the end of the video:**
*We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."* -Aristotle
